# BellaBeat: Using R to research relations in fitness metrics. 

# Introduction
In this case study BellaBeat has hired me as a junior data analyst. BellaBeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
 products for women. They sell several smart devices tracking activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health. My task is to identify trends found in fitness data gathered by Fitbit. By doing this they hope to be able to gather valuable information to improve their own marketing strategy. 

To answer this question, I will go through the process of:

**Ask:** What is the business question that has to be addressed and how to get to the answer?

**Prepare**: How to gather good quality data to answer this question?

**Process:** Clean and prepare data for analysis.

**Analyze:** Analyze the data to get meaningful results, relating to the question to be answered.

**Share:** Make compelling visuals in line with what you want to convey to your stakeholders.

**Act:** Give recommendations to BellaBeat to improve their marketing campaign. 

# Ask

As stated before, I am going to identy trends in Fitbit Data so BellaBeat can improve their marketing campaign. More broadly, the following questions will be addressed in this report:

1\. What are some trends in smart device usage?   
2\. How could these trends apply to BellaBeat customers?  
3\. How could these trends help influence BellaBeat marketing strategy?

The following are the stakeholders for which this report is made and will be presented to:

* Urška Sršen: BellaBeat’s co founder and Chief Creative Officer   
* Sando Mur: Mathematician and BellaBeat’s co-founder; key member of the BellaBeat executive team

# Prepare 

**Data Source**  
This dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 and 12 May.2016. The dataset I used is from 12 March 00:00 AM  till 13 May 08:00 AM.   
The data is locally stored in the folder "...\\Google Course Data\\Capstone\_Project\_Bellabeat\\Data"  

**Data Validity**   
It could be that these respondents are not representative for the average personal tracker user, since mainly young and internet savvy people will be online doing these types of surveys. This is something to keep in mind, because it could bias the analysis.   
Different Fitbit trackers were used to gather this data. This is very important to note, since some of the trends found in the data could be due to different Fitbit trackers.    
The data comes from 2016. This is 8 years old and could therefore be outdated. However, for the sake of practicing, I will ignore this.   
The data comes directly from the user’s Fitbit, so the data is original. 

**Daily Activity Dataset**  
The data is organized in a long format. The data description states that there are 30 respondents, while some databases show 34 different Id’s. I wonder where this discrepancy comes from.  This dataset is quite comprehensive, since it contains: Id,  Activity Date, Total Steps, Total Distance, Tracker Distance, Logged Activities Distance, Very Active Distance, Moderately Active Distance, Light Active Distance, Sedentary Active Distance, Very Active Minutes, Fairly Active Minutes, Lightly Active Minutes, Sedentary Minutes. The maximum and minimum values of each column seem reasonable.

**Sleep Dataset**  
This dataset contains the following variables:  Id, SleepDay, TotalSleepRecord, TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalTimeInBed. The maximum and minimum values of each column seem reasonable.


**Limitations of the data:**
* Only 30 participants present in the dataset.  
* The amount of time is limited to two months. 

# Process

**Activity Data**
* Using R, I merged the 'dailyActivity_merged.csv' containing data from March/April and 'dailyActivity_merged2.csv' containing data from March/April.  
* I found some days with only 0 values in the Daily Activity database and removed these. I think these were the days when the device wasn’t used.  
* I found some duplicates on the last day of the first dataset and the first day of the second dataset. I will remove the records from the last day of the first set, since in the da
taset, showing the steps taken per hour, one can see that that day start from 12AM, so the whole day is registered.  
* “ActivityDate” was incorrectly categorized as “Character”, so I corrected this to “Date”. I checked for empty and NULL values, which were not present. 

**Sleep Dataset**  
* Renamed the “SleepDay” column to “Day” to avoid ambiguity with the dataset name “sleepDay”.  
* Removed 3 duplicates from the sleepDay dataset.   
* Checked for empty and NULL values, which were not present.  
* Removed the times from Day column, to only keep the date.  



# Analyze/Share

**Check for normality**  
I checked whether the variables ‘calories’ and ‘amount of sleep’ are normally distributed. However, they were not. Therefore, I only used the non-parametric Spearman’s correlation test.

**Correlations with Calories**  
I calculated the spearman’s correlations with calories and the other variables, to see what influences the amount of calories spent the most. One can see that the strongest correlations were with "TotalSteps", "TotalDistance" and "VeryActiveMinutes".

**Relation calories/ very active minutes**   
I calculated the correlation between calories and the amount of very active minutes. However, since the amount of calories is not normally distributed, I could only use non-parametric tests. Spearman’s correlation  test gives a correlation of  0.52 with a  p-value \< 2.2e-16. This means there is a moderate monotonic relation between calories and the amount of steps taken.

**Relation calories/steps**  
I calculated the correlation between calories and total steps. Spearman’s correlation  test gives a correlation of  0.55 with a  p-value \< 2.2e-16. This means there is a moderate monotonic relation between calories and the amount of steps taken.

**Relation sleep/sedentary activity**  
I also calculated the correlation between the amount of minutes slept and the amount of sedentary activity the next day spent the next day. Amount of minutes slept is not normally distributed, therefore I used Spearman’s correlation. This gave a correlation of  \-0.57, with p-value \<2.2e-16, this means there is a moderate negative monotonic relation between the amount of minutes slept and the amount of sedentary activity.

**Relation sleep/calories**  
I also calculated the relation between amount of sleep and calories by the use of Spearman's correlation. However, this relation was not significant, which is not surprising as one sees the bar chart.

**Relation steps taken and weight change**   
I also wanted to calculate the relation between total steps per Id and the weight change. However, there were only 8 participants in this group, which is too little to draw any conclusions from. 

The data set description states that different Fitbit types were used in this dataset. I haven't noticed this during my analysis, but this could have influenced the results nonetheless. 

# Act

Let’s get back to the initial research questions:  
**1\. What are some trends in smart device usage?**   
**2\. How could these trends apply to BellaBeat customers?**  
**3\. How could these trends help influence BellaBeat marketing strategy?**

**1\. What are some trends in smart device usage?**   
The following monotonic relations have been found:

* A moderate positive relation between ‘total steps’ and ‘calories’.  
* A moderate positive relation ‘very active minutes’ and ‘calories’.  
* A moderate negative relation between ‘sleep’ and ‘sedentary activity’.

This data suggests that on days when one walks or spends more ‘very active’ minutes more one tends to burn more calories. It cannot be said whether this is a linear relation or not. It can also not be said for certain if this relation is causative. Since burning calories doesn’t cause any activity, but is caused by activity one could assume that there is a causative relation. However, there could also be a confounding variable, influencing both.   
The same holds true for the monotonic relation between ‘sleep’ and ‘sedentary activity’. I therefore would suggest to do more research.

**2\. How could these trends apply to BellaBeat customers?**  
One could use their BellaBeat as a step counter to motivate oneself to take more steps, so one could burn more calories.Also one could use the BellaBeat to motivate oneself to spend more time being very active, so one could burn more calories.Also BellaBeat users could measure one’s sleep, to motivate oneself to be more active the next day. 

**3\. How could these trends help influence BellaBeat marketing strategy?**  
The BellaBeat team could use these findings to promote the effectiveness of tracking sleep and activity. They could promote how it influences calories burnt and how more sleep has a relation with less sedentary activity.   
Right now, BellaBeat collects data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health. They could possibly add a step tracker, since this is correlated with more calories burnt.
